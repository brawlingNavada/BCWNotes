Scope

the id of an html tag become a GLOBAL variable.

window is a gigatntic object.

When you assign an id it becomes window.id

If you create a global variable it is a assigned to window.id

Do you know what encapsulation is?
	Having isolate scopes.
	Think of scope as a container that holds something.

There is a big difference between undefined and not defined.
	not defined is a show stopper (it will throw error and stop code).
	
A variable defined within a function only exists when then function is active in memory.

Omitting the var keyword and invoking the function will put the variables into global memory -- and they will persist in memory even after the code has finished executing.

When you define a function, none of the code within the function runs.
It does not exist until invoked.

=====
Never create a variable without using var, or let or const keyword!
=====

function GameController()
{

}


If somone is getting an object by refrence the can manupulate it and change data inconsisteny.
make sure that you are returning primative values, NOT objects.



function gameController(name){
	var player = name

	this.getPlayerName = function()
	{
		return player.name
	}
	}

gc1 = newGameController(jake)

var funciton.attack = function()
{
	player.health -= 10;
}

Closure is when an inner function has access to an outer variable even after the function that created it dies.

sOlid : Open for extension, closed for modification.

a _ underscore denotes a private variable.
_player is a private variable.
 
"service" aproximately equal to "store"

 Key: Variable declared in a function are hidden form any code outside of its definition.

//Some sample code I wrote to illustrate this -- has not been verified yet.

function OuterFunction()
{
    	//encapsulated data kept here
        var data01="JWTO"
	//end of encapsulated data

	//example of a getter function
	this.getData01 = function()
	{
	return data01;
	}
}

//In console
x = new OuterFunction()
//x is now an object that has encapsulated data in data01.
//you can use the gitData01 method to read the data.
//there is no way to write to this data without a setter function.


function OuterFunction()
{
	[data area]

	this.innerFunction01 = function()
	{code goes here}

	this.innerfunction02 = function()
	{code goes here}
}

(elsewhere...)
var x = new OuterFunction()
x has methods (innerFunctions above that can access the [data area].  Otherwise it is inaccessible.
