=====GIT=====
Source Control
Github is not the same thing as git.
Github is just a pretty interface for a git server.
A git server listens for the those types of pushes.
 

Naming convention for a directory.
lowercase only
use hyphen for space

change relevant directories to lowercase.


code . --> use to start Visual Studio Code in the current folder.


The folders open explorer.


download relevant programs onto Linux side.

git remote add origin https://github.com/jakceoverall/day-one.git

what this is saying is origin is https://github...

then

git push -u origin master
git push (upstream to) origin (which is the remote repo location) master (branch)
git push upstream [remote location] [branch]
git push upstream to [remote location] [branch]

create this as a branch gh-pages <-- this needs to be created as branch

=====Updateing against github io=====

make changes on local repo
confirm they are good
git add
git commit (against branch master)
git pull
git push

On github website on branch master make a pull request.
Compare master with gh-pages
Resolve conflicts

A container is a <div class="container">
A fluid container is a <div class="container-fluid">  It will always expand to
fill the width of the screen.

A row acts like a wrapper around the columns.
OQ: Is it accurate the say that a column is like a cell and the row is like the
container that holdds to cells?
It is created by adding a class of .row to a block level element inside the
container.

Different sized column prefixes for different sized devices.
.col-xs-
.col-sm-
.col-md-
.col-lg-

ProTip: Design for the smaller screen first.

To nest a grid within a column the container is already defined.
Columns behave as containers for a nested grid system.

Container
row

You create a container with a <div> of class container.
You create a row with a <div> of class row.
You creat a cell within a row by creating a div of class "col-xx-#"
where xx is sx|sm|md|lg and n is the width of the cell (a number that evently
divides 12 i.e. 12,6,4,3,2,1).

Offsetting colums
you can use offseting classes
ex: .col-xs-offset-*
Card: ex: .col-md-offset-* will put placeholders to the LEFT.

Reording
Card: .col-md-push-* and .col-md-pull-* will shift a column to the left or right.
