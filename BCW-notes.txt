CQ: How do you add a background image to a webpage using CSS?  How do you prevent that image from tiling?  How do you center that image? 
body 	{
	background-image:url("URLGoesHere");

	background-position: top center;
	
}

CQ: What are the choices for backround position? 
top left
top center
top right
center left
center center
center right
bottom left
bottom center
bottom right
x% y%
xpos ypos (where xpos and ypos are given in pixles).



CQ: How to you add a color wash behind a css element?
CHEAT: How to you add a color wash behind a css element? --> background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, .85);
RGB is a 3-channel format containing data for Red, Green, and Blue. RGBA is a 4-channel format containing data for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha.
There is no use to the Alpha channel other than making the color transparent/opaque (or partially transparent; translucent).
In CSS, rgb() had wide browser support for several years before rgba() received the same level of support. This is one reason you will find more rgb() in CSS than rgba(). The other reason is that translucency isn't something you typically use everywhere.
In CSS, the designers decided to use values 0-255 (the range for an 8 bit value) for the Red, Green, and Blue, but they use a value between 0.0 and 1.0 for the Alpha channel. 

CQ: How do you set a backround image to spread accross the whole backround?
background-size: cover;

CQ: How to change css properties using jQuery?
css("propertyname","value");
Example: $("body").css("background-image", "url('travago.jpg')");


Q: How to set a browser element to be the size of the viewport (161223)
What are Viewport-Percentage Lengths?
The viewport-percentage lengths are relative to the size of the initial containing block. When the height or width of the initial containing block is changed, they are scaled accordingly. These units are vh (viewport height), vw (viewport width), vmin (viewport minimum length) and vmax (viewport maximum length).  How can this be used to make a divider fill the height of the browser? For this question, we can make use of vh: 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport's height. That is to say, 100vh is equal to the height of the browser window, regardless of where the element is situated in the DOM tree:
HTML
<div></div>
CSS
div {height:100vh;}

CQ: What are the differences between setting a style in CSS and changing it with the .css method? (161223)

body {background-image:url("images/travago.jpg");}
$("body").css("background-image","url('images/adams.jpg')"); <-- note the absence of the : and the ;
hint: be mindful of your colons.

CQ: When referencing a function call in a jQuery .click method do you include the parens? (161223)
No. 
 $("#changePic").click(changePic);  <-- when the item id'd as changePic is clicked the chagePic function is called.  Note the absence of parens in the handler.


CQ: How do you open up multiple files simultaneously in vim? (161223)
vim -o file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

CQ: How do you switch between multiple windows in vim? (161223)
[ctrl]+w <arrow key>

CQ: How do you link an external style sheet? (161223)
<link rel = "stylesheet"
  type = "text/css"
  href = "myStyle.css" />

Pulling JSON data on command line with curl.
$ URL='https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php?action=wbgetentities&ids=Q39246&format=json'

$ curl -s $URL | jq '.entities[].labels.en.value'

--> "Richard Feynman"

Main:      action = query 
               format = json
Action:     list = search
List:          srsearch = Albert Einstein
               srlimit = 10
               sroffset = 0




var baseURL = "https://en.wikipedia.org//w/api.php?action=query&format=json&list=search&utf8=1&srsearch=Albert+Einstein"
if you pull down this data and store in variable x
x.query.search.[0] returns the title of the 0th entry.

Object.keys(x)  --> ["batchcomplete", "continue", "query"]

x.continue -->
Object {
continue: "-||",
sroffset: 10
}

I think what this is telling me that if I wan to pull in more data have to set the sroffset to ten on subsequent request.
x.continue.sroffset --> 10

for (n=0;n<10;n++) {console.log(x.query.search[n].title)};
prints out all of the titles in the search to the log.

function takeResultsData(json)
{
  console.log("in takeResultsData")
  x = json;
  var output = [];
  for (n=0;n<10;n++)
    {
      output.push(x.query.search[n].title);
    }
      console.log(output);
}
 output is an array of titles.
