OQ: Does javascript have constants?

Don't use double quotes in javascript.
There are three different ways to create a string, single quotes, double quotes and backtick.

always, always use var.
absent the var it is a global.  You hardly ever want this.

when utalizing a bool never use string characters.

'' <-- false
' ' <-- truthy
'false' <-- truthy

True <-- NOT a bool.
False <-- NOT a bool.

[Ctrl]+/ to comment out.

In javascript, unlike other languages, you can create objects on the fly.

var bowl = {
brand: 'Kelloggs',
name: 'frosted flakes'};

Card: Objects are passed by refrence, not value.
Card: Primatives are passed by value.
Card: An array is a collection of LIKE datatypes.  They are different from objects.  An object is a single instance of a single object.

Task: write up a demo to show passed by references where you change 
	myObject = {...}
	copyOfmyObject = {...}
	changing a value of copyOfMyObject should be reflected if log.console on myObject.

Key: Objects and arrays are basically the same but objects have a Key while arrays have an Index.

If you are pointed at object you can make an assignment and it will change.
If you are pointed at a PRIMITAVE you CANNOT make an assignment.

Key: all object oriented programing is a collection of independnet objects.
