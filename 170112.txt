Read: Very good summary of what coding is: http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/09/economist-explains-3

Bootstrap has a fixed nav bar.
there is a class called text white in bootstrap!
A hero element is the main element on a page.

Task: try to clone the cafezupas website.

In bootstrap The only elements that should be imeedate children of a container shold have a class of row!
The hardest part of CSS positioning elements.
	This is why CSS frameworks - it takes the effort of this.
	Not all frameworks use a 12 colum grid system.
	The 12 column grid is industry standard.  Stay with frameworks with these types of grids.

Continer
	.Row
	.Row
	.Row

.Row <-- this will result in horzontal scrolling. (because it is NOT in the container).

You need to be able to do this quickly and efficinetly. 
Task: [] copy websites and concentrate on getting the layout correct.

It is worth your time to master the grid system.

Container
Container (this is ok in bootstrap)

Container
Row <-- this is no good. because a Continer and a Row cannot be a silibing

---------
Container
---------
	---------
	Row
	----------
		[ Column ]					[
		[	]This is where you stuff gows		[close the row,
		[	]					[

to style add a class not an Id.

You can infinateldy subdivide by 12.

Do not next columns inside of columns.
Container
Row
Column
Row
Column
Row....



.contaier : centers stuff - good for stuff you dont want edge to edge.
.container-fluid : does not not center - good for full width elements.

you can also specify a class for stiling purposeds on a .continer.

DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING IN THE BOX MODEL IN CONTAINER/ROW/COLUMN! Once you are inside the DIV inside the colun do what you want.

Bootstrap
Foundation
Materialize are most comon frameworks.

mkdir cafe-menu
touch index.html
touch style.css
<link rel="bhal" href="blah"> {futuer hint scripts load through src not rel}

.container
.container[tab] <-- will open a div container quickly.
.row[tab] <-- will open a row quckly

OQ: How to do word wraping in VS code?

lorem[#][tab] will give you that number of works in lourm ipsum.
lorem[50][tab] will give you 50 words of lorem text.

div.text-center[tab]
button.btn.btn-primary[tab]
butons can be primary, danger, warning, info (review button types in boostrap docs).

you can apply the center-text on the column level or the row level.

<div class = ".col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3"> <--this gives you a column of 6 with a margin of three.`
col-[size]-offset-[number]

bootstrap has pannels (which are simlar to a card)

.row[tab]
ProTip: When you are done with a section, complase it.
ProTip:Alt shift F will automatically format code (right click format docunment)
If you keep your code collapsed the tabbing tells you if you are at container, row, and colum level.

If you have two columns make sure the offset is applied to the first column.
ex:
col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-2 <--note that the offset is applied to the first element becasue you want the 
				offset to be to the left of the first coumn and NOT Between them.
col-col-sm-4

OQ: What is a pannel in bootstrap?
OQ: What is a well in bootstrap?

.pannel>.pannel-heading>.h3[tab]
.pannel-heading
.pannel-body

.pannel
	pannel-heading
	pannel-body

To put space beween row add margint to the elements not within the row --- this violateds the box model protpery!

m-t-20 <-- Jake's class margin top 20.

.col-sm-3[tab]
.well>img[tab]  <-- create a well and side of that put an image.
> means the put this tag inside the first.
class = "img-responsive" <-- as screen grows so does the image.

.text-center is a class.
image-responsive turn it into a block element.

jamielacivita/jamielacivita.github.io <-- the index page in this repo is where you landing page goes.

[] Resueme and Landing Page should be layouted by the end of the week.
