Model (service) View Controller

What is job of controller?
==========================
	Does not manage object.
	Fetches content for the view.
	The controler changes all of the time with diffrent frameworks.
	The contorller helps us interact with the dom.
	Is lightwight
	Is in the middle.
	Anything document. {something} belongs in the controler.
	If it manupulates the page it belogs in the contorller.
	The first thing you put in the controller is a constructor.
	The first thing in the consctrctor is an instatntation of the service.
	Ex: var studentService = new StudnetService() <-- this invokes the service.  It s the first line inside the controler's 
	If it is not on the .this keyword it will not be avaiable for anything else.
	The very bottom line of the controller should be the triger to initally load the page. 
		Ex: this.handel.Reset()
	Service and View never talk to each other.  They should not be open in your editor at the same time.
	if something is on .this on the controller it better be something that the user is going to touch.
	HTML written to the page is done in the controller.


What is job of the serivce (model)?  var dcCharacters = getCharacters(arr,uni1)
==================================
	The reason this is both service and model is becasue you have functions (service) and data (model)
	This is the part where you manupulate objects.
	This part is relatively static.
		For loop
		slice
		splice
	Deals with the the complexity of the object.
	Your data goes into the service.

	This file begins with a constructor function.
	When passing arrays you can make a COPY and send that COPY out to the contorller.
		You do with with splice.
	Your geters in this file look like: this.functionName = function(){code here}.

	REMEMBER: before you can us this data it must be instatntiated.  
	Ex: var studentService = new StudentService()
	If it manupulates the object it beclongs in the service.

Refactoring taking code that is working and making it more scaleable.

Load Order in HTML file.
1. Services
2. Controllers (this loads second because controllers require serivces to be loaded first).
3. Run the app.

Goal is to change as little code a possible to change things.
Save and test often.
If devtool are open, you can hold click on reload and call it as "empty cash and reload."
You cannot be afraid to brake you code.
If your intellisense isn't helping you you are probably writing your code wrong.

See this cheetsheet as well : https://bcw-cheatsheets.herokuapp.com/cheatsheets/18
You want to use encapsulation to shape the data avaiable to the user.


The app.js
==========
This is how you initaize the project.
You do this by instationing a controler object.
	ex: 

In the HTML
===========
  sum = sum + forEach(arr_cart)
  

 User Story
 ==========

Template Strings
================
The gole withe the template string is to write out HTML which will be injected onto the page.

Example:
	var template = `<ul>`;
	for (var char of dcChars)
	{
	template += `<li>${char.name}</li>`
	}

See codefoo 2446
placehold.it/200x200 --> will return a placeholder of size 200x200.

Services/Model opens with a constructor function
This function does not return anything.
It holds model data.
It holds methods to CRUD that data.
The methods each begin with the syntax:
	this.functionName = function([parameters])

The Conroller file opens with a constructor function
The first line of this construcor function calls creates an instance of the Service/Model object.
This file functions to draw data to the screen.
Does this file contain methods to pull data from screen. 

The app.js file creates an instance of the Controller object.
This controller object is manupulated to add stuff to the screen by invoking controller methods.
