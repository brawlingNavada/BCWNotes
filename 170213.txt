Front end frameworks have a router.

Routing on front end is different than the backend.
	Front end routing preserves state.

	OQ: build system on front end?

	Need to review vue components.  Rewrite inspire.

	Review and be able to talk intellegetnly about -- Model view controller

CLI
used to generated tools.
provides a platform, scaffold to all you to build your app faster.

we are going to use webpack
You could spend weeks trying to learn how webpack works.
(not worth your time - frameworks already do is).

In the future you will want to to do this. 


OQ: What exactly is webpack.

control shift b
click on npm drop down
OQ: what does a taks runner tod?

Build task is not set up bcy defaultl


        {             "taskName": "test",             "args": ["run", "test"]         },            {             "taskName": "build",             "args": ["run", "dev"]         }     ] }
																		==========================  <-- this is the parts that is added.

	then control shit + b

src is where we will write our code.

main.js is the file that starts the vue application..

import is simiar to require on the node side of things.
On the frontend we use import

Vue wants you to build componetents.

inspect app.vue (this is not javascript)
in this file you write your code between the scipt tags.

inside components there is a hello vue.

templates are generated inside of a template tage.
Review slap game functionality -- obselete but a useful model.

Review VUE docs.  
	Docs for this template <--review this
	Core does <-- review this.

control shift=b will stop and restart the server.

in class we downloaded pug and stylus

you are working in the source > components > hello.vue file.

to add a new componet
add a blank filue inder come.

there is a way to import components from other files into the 'master componet file.'

vue props

:propery = "object you want to pass"
object you want to pass is what you are v foring.
you need to add a props in the script tag to show the child object were are getting data from parent scope.


for example: v-for r 

:room="r"

props: is recieving a propery from a parent scope.
props: ~stuff I want to get from the parent scope~

the v-for isn in the parent 
in the v-for  

coding game

codegame.com
	start with onboarding

Orgnization of external resources
==================================

at the botte m of he file when you want to expeort a fie.

export ...

and there should be an equlivalant import in the file to which you are dragging stuff to.

1.) code data in single file
2.) split object into mulitple files.

:x <-- when you are binding in a parent this is what you need to call the item in the child item.

If you want to use a compent you need to regrester
	the view file will have a templant, script and style

	<template>
	This is a test.
	</template>

	at the script 
	<script>
	export default { props: ['x']}

	components : {}


	</script>

	this. <-- only refers to the vue componet.

	any information you want on down the line, you have to pass it through on a prop.
	this happens a lot in v-fors.

	pojo : plain old javascript object
