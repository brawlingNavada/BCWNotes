Memorize this code snppit:

===============
Backtick Syntax
===============


var mytable = document.getElementById("mytable") 
mytable.innerHTML = "JWTO"

the backtick `
puts you into template mode.
Then replace variables with ${variableName}

You can now put the code on multiple lines.

codefoo 2306 <-- example of backtick syntax.

=============
Breakponits
=============

type debugger into the Visual Studio the code will stop at that point
This is a javascript function and will work in any editor
You can add a brakepoint by clicking on a line number in developer tools / sources.
You can hover over stuff to actually see what is going on.
If you wind up a minified file, use the step out arrow wich is the dot with an up arrow.
Step over is the left most arrow over a dot.

Arrow point at a dot is a step-into.
The hover function will not work when you are out scope
 
Network > Disable Cashe

you can log a bunch of stuff in console.log(object1, object2, object3)

A TOKEN is a chunk of code fed into the compliler.

string.trim removes leading and trailing whitespace.

Review Fizz Buzz

OQ: On the rock paper scizzors can you create an object that populates the html so you don't have to call a bunch of functions?

<input type = "text" id = "new-student">
<button onClick="addStudent()">Add Student</button>

var studentName = document.getElementById("new-student").value

JavaScript is single threaded.

The splice method removes an element from an array.

array.splice( [indexToStartAt] , [howManyToRemove], [ReplacmentItem]) --> Returns an array of what is removed.  It modifies the original array.

splice is destructive -- it modifies the origional data.

slice is a non-destructive way to get part of an array.

Objects are passed by refrence ... so the is a shallow copy.

==========
For Each in javascript is a method


This is the way to iterate over an object.
for(var key in button)
{
	document.write(key + '<br>')
}
docunment.write('<hr>')


Practice iterating over objects and reutring an particular value.
